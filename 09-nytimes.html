	<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>For several years I contributed illustrations to The New York Times Op-Ed page. I learned the excitement of this work from assisting (the master) Stephen Doyle at Doyle Partners on a variety of assignments. A working draft of the letter or editorial was sent by 9am. Sketches were due by noon. Final art due by 4pm. Even if the idea came in a flash, this almost always consumed a full day.
		<br>

	<h3>Design Problems</h3>
		<p>I was called to do my first piece by then Art Director Brian Rea. I was working as a designer at Interbrand when he called at 9am. He sent me the article and these brief specs:</p>

			<div class="preformatted">
			<p id="mono">2.15" wide x 2.5" tall<br>
			b/w<br>
			$175.<br>
			sketches by 2pm<br>
			final by 6-6:30pm</p>
			</div>

	<p>I had to decide to either take the day off and work on it at home, or sneak the work into my daily routine as a brand designer. I decided to take the assignment and stay at work. Getting paid twice also sounded thrilling (though at the time spot illos only went for $50 USD). The piece was on the “paper trail” left by election machines and other voting mechanisms in the run up to the 2008 presidential election. I sketched 20 pencil ideas and scanned them (pre-iPhone!) to email them for review. The chosen concept was the word vote cut out of a long and twisting piece of paper. I printed the letters in a heavy slab serif. Cut them out of white paper and stitch them to a board. I photographed the white paper and shadows with a borrowed SLR and gave it about 20min of retouching.</p>

	<h3>Visual Language</h3>
		<p>Newspaper is very forgiving to simple black and white sculptural photography as it reminds you of the halftimes it is famous for. I bought the paper the next morning at a newsstand and was in heaven.

		<p>The speed. The intensity. The massive audience. It was a dream come true, and hardly sustainable. Over the years I did quite a few more. Always with typography, often with a camera. I never developed a style, but loved the collection nonetheless. It offered a dramatic change of pace to the slow and anonymous corporate brand work I was doing at the time.</p>
