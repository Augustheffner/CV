	<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>For several years I contributed illustrations to The New York Times Op-Ed page. I learned the excitement of this work from assisting (the master) Stephen Doyle at Doyle Partners on a variety of assignments. A working draft of the letter or editorial was sent by 9am. Sketches were due by noon. Final art due by 4pm. Even if the idea came in a flash, this almost always consumed a full day.
		<br>

	<h3>Design Problems</h3>
		<p>I was called to do my first piece by then Art Director Brian Rea. I was working as a designer at Interbrand when he called at 9am. I had to decide to either take the day off and work on it at home, or sneak the work into my daily routine as a brand designer. I decided to take the assignment and stay at work. Getting paid twice also sounded thrilling (though at the time spot illos only went for $50 USD). The piece was on the “paper trail” left by election machines and other voting mechanisms in the run up to the 2008 presidential election. I sketched 20 pencil ideas and scanned them (pre-iPhone!) to email them for review. The chosen concept was the word vote cut out of a long and twisting piece of paper. I printed the letters in a heavy slab serif. Cut them out of white paper and stitch them to a board. I photographed the white paper and shadows with a borrowed SLR and gave it about 20min of retouching. Newspaper is very forgiving to simple black and white sculptural photography as it reminds you of the halftimes it is famous for. I bought the paper the next morning at a newsstand and was in heaven. </p>


	<h3>Visual Language</h3>
		<p>The speed. The intensity. The massive audience. It was a dream come true, and hardly sustainable. Over the years I did quite a few more. Always with typography, often with a camera. I never developed a style, but loved the collection nonetheless. It offered a dramatic change of pace to the slow and anonymous corporate brand work I was doing at the time.</p>
