	<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>PATH is a global health NGO who have been at the forefront of the most far-reaching life-improving innovations of the past 40 years. The engaged Instrument to help them navigate a long overdue rebrand and digital overhaul. We began with a six week discovery into their 20k page archive of disconnected digital publishing.</p>

	<h3>Design Problems</h3>
	<p>The challenge was to clearly and concisely explain the very complex and collaborative work that PATH does across a huge range of health areas on nearly every continent. So we decided to avoid this problem, or the concise part at least. Because we realized our job was not to solicit $5 donations with urgent pleas. The magic of PATH was reading their stories of innovation and retelling them to friends in sound bites: “the vial sticker that saved millions of lives” “the one grain of rice that gives millions of kids the vitamins the need” “the bike-pump-enabled oxygen difusser for premature babies” “the self injected birth control”.</p>

	<p>The headlines didn’t tell the whole story, but they sucked you in. PATH didn’t need a new “about us” website, the needed a publishing platform. And what’s more, PATH employees around the globe were publishing, but to their own blogs. Into quiet corners of the internet. They needed to funnel into the main channel and get to the donors, partners, and scientists who needed the cross-referencing. The Malaria + devices + vaccines.</p>

	<h3>Three templates</h3>
	<p>So we decided a system with three templates. Basically a home page, an article page and a glorified search results page for each disease and health area. Then it took 6 months to agree on an INformation architecture. The three templates was an oversimplification, they needed more tools in order to publish specific research for highly specialized programs, but the design system was there, publish through PATH.org and avoid dispersion.</p>

	<h3>Radically accessible</h3>
	<p>During our initial audit we knew we’d find traffic from all over the world, including areas with low internet connectivity. What we didn’t expect was the variety of devices. It’s easy to focus on iPhones and Pixels in Urban centers of the world but when the Opera Mini browser pops up in you analytics, you need to think about flip phones.</p>
