		<p>This work was completed with the amazing talent of The Museum of Modern Art's Marketing, Design, and Digital Media departments. Kim Michell & Julia Hoffmann lead the charge. Our studio consisted of Brigitta Bungard, Ingrid Chou, Sam Sherman, Inva Cota, Claire Corey, Althea Penza, Jesse Reed, Amanda Pastenkos, Reed Burgoyne, Joel Stillman, and so many more.</p>

	<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>In 2008, Pentagram Partner Paula Scher took on a re-brand of The Museum of Modern Art<a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/moma/story" target="_blank">&#x00b9</a> in New York City. She helped install her lead Creative on the project, Julia Hoffmann<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-hoffmann-00299/" target="_blank">&#x00b2</a>, as Creative Director of the museum’s in-house studio. An effort to further realize the project’s vision of a unified brand identity the marketing design and exhibition design departments were merged and brought closer to the digital media group. I was hired by Hoffman and CMO Kim Mitchell&#x00b3 to help join the disciplines and bring the both closer to digital fluency.

	<h3>Design Problems</h3>
	<p>The first task was Ms. Scher’s proposed design moves which, typical of her genius, were less prescriptive and more attitudinal. She created massive tension utilizing the MoMA logo vertically and smashing artwork and typography together in the ways only she could. We refined this idea through countless design challenges but </p>

The result was constant evaluation of the use of typography throughout the institution.

	<h3>Typefaces</h3>
	<p>The museum originally printed its own materials and had its own letterpress alphabet of Morris’s Fuller Benton’s Franklin Gothic. The use of the heaviest weight (later committed to digital font by the name of MoMA Gothic) became ubiquitous with the museum’s identity through it use in the fully name word mark (refined by Ivan Chermayeff in 19xx) (3) and it’s use in the museum’s “MoMA” logotype (refined by Matthew Carter in 20xx). It’s use in signage and museum materials was revived by our team as core to the institutional brand. But for content as vast as its catalogue we committed to a magazine metaphor for typeface use. The lobby (contents) and collection shows (departments) stuck with MoMA Gothic while special exhibitions (features) had the freedoms to trybon new voices, so long as the mixed well and had the same typographic attitude.

	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>The result was Exhibition typography as expressive and varied as the content itself. And despite criticism throughout the halls, we created dramatic title walls that encouraged visitors to stage selfies.</p>

I was told that both I.M. Pei and Steven Heller complimented my design, but I cannot confirm this. <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/303">MoMA.org &#x2197</a></p>
