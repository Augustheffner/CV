	<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>In 2013 I was recruited to become Design Director of J.Crew’s newly formed marketing department. For 30 years the retail company’s marketing was delivered to your doorstep in the form of a catalog. While this drove traffic to their hundreds of stores worldwide, and eventually to the brands e-commerce site, advertising, branding and marketing where one-off and definitely afterthoughts.

Oh, and fonts were divided by gender. Didot for women and Caslon for men.</p>

		<p>The obvious and outdated stereotypes this fed into were one thing. The pure typographic chaos was another. Still whatever our opinions on gender fluidity in the office, the “female” and “male” products remained quite different and shared little aesthetically.
