All writing by Alison Griffin, Halsey Anderson, Lisa Lundy and their team.</p>

	<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>In 2013 I was recruited to become Design Director of J.Crew’s newly formed marketing department. For 30 years the retail company’s marketing was delivered to your doorstep in the form of a catalog. While this drove traffic to their hundreds of stores worldwide, and eventually to the brands e-commerce site, advertising, branding and marketing where one-off and definitely afterthoughts.</p>

		<p>Lead by the mythical Brooklyn-native CEO Mikey Drexler and the legendary, Jenna Lyons, as president the brand took off in the early 2000s, investing in third party heritage brands, expanding its demographic with its sister brand Madewell and hiring R/GA and Kate Spade alum, Johanna Langford, as VP of Creative to help tell the story. Joanna hired me and taught me a lot.

	<h3>Design Problems</h3>
		<p>I lead a team of nine designers and we sat in the middle of a catalog and e-commerce publishing cadence. We reviewed all of our work with Jenna biweekly. We focused on the opening spread of the catalog, advertising campaigns online, out of home and in print, the monthly store marketing and story-tellingly, website refreshes, 3 emails (men,women and kids!) every single day, printed materials and anything else you can imagine.</p>

	<h3>Gender and typefaces</h3>
	<p>One of my first assignments was to create systems. For everything. Not only did the brand have at least four (different!) logos being used at any given time, it had a host of “sub brands” (J.Crew Collection, J.Crew Jewery, J.Crew Factory, Very Personal Stylists) all with their own flavor and fonts. Oh, and fonts were divided by gender. Didot for women and Caslon for men.</p>
