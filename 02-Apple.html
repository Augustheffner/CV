Our goal was to push the Apple’s visual language and integrate the new-to-marketing SFSans typography system. The result was a bold use of regular weights and annoversized clarity towards communication. Our work was blessed by Sir Jonny Ive’s product team as well as Marcom. So we began production...</p>
